# MATHEso

Welcome to MATHEso (Pronounced "ma-thee-so")!
MATHEso is a type of Esolang that runs entirely based on Math! Instead of regular function, like `function main() {}` or `public static void main () {}`, MATHEso uses the format `f(x) = mx + b;`, among other functions. Variables are defined like they are in python, like `a = 1`. String characters are not accepted, and the program will read them as multiplication.

> For those who don't know, TypeScript is a great coding language for creating your own coding languages. I highly recomend finding tutorials if you are interested in creating your own programming language. Currently I have no recomendations, but there are some great tutorials on YouTube if you're interested!


##### This coding language is a WIP!
I will provide usage and download instructions when I finish this coding language! I currently have finished up the base lexer for my code. Please contact me at [victormer235hs@gmail.com] if you have any questions.

### I WILL PUT OUT A GUIDE ON HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN CODING LANGUAGE!
#### This will be the start of the guide here. It will walk you through some of the basics of building your own coding language, using examples from my own, MATHEso

Whether you have wondered how a coding language works, or you want to make one yourself, this will explain (to the best of my ability) what it requires.

Most coding languages, aside for a couple esoteric languages, involve three main parts to it; A lexer, a parser, and a compiler. Each one processes what are called "Tokens," which are just the characters in your code. The lexer gathers all the tokens and assigns a type to each one, for example a `NUMBER` token or an `OPERATOR` token. The parser takes this and sets the values in a tree, so that the compiler can then process your code to the computer, and output whatever the code says to do. This is about as simple as I can explain it, so let's get into the first step!
#### Will update as I continue the code
